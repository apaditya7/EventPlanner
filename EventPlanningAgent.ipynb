Plenty of venues in Singapore charge per person or per hour. Some spaces can be rented for $50 to $1,926 per hour or $30 to $95 per person. Minimum spend rates vary from $800 up to $7,490. (All data from Tagvenue.)\n",
      "Which areas in Singapore have the best party launch venues?\n",
      "In Singapore, you are spoilt for choice when it comes to fantastic product launch venues in stunning locations. The majority of venues are located in the Central Area, as well as Tanjong Pagar and Civic District. Bukit Merah, Kallang and Orchard all have several event spaces, halls and meeting rooms that are worth checking out. Areas such as Katong or Bedok are hubs of fantastic restaurants and studio spaces. This is also true for the Novena and Geylang areas, which both offer amazing suites, banquet rooms and studios. With such a wide selection you should have no problems finding a perfect place for the launch of your product.\n",
      "What should I consider when renting a product launch venue?\n",
      "Planning a product launch party is quite a task, but there are a few quick tips that should help you get started First of all, consider your technical needs for the space. Will you need flat screens or a stage and a mic? Is the WIFI at the venue strong enough for your needs if you will have any virtual guests? Many venues nowadays come fully equipped for hi-tech events, but be sure and discuss your needs with the venue manager before your book. Also, for guests from farther away, you may need to choose a location that is near central transport links as well as offer parking. Considering today’s capacity restrictions, you may also want to consider whether you will be having a sit-down or standing event. The square meterage of the space will determine the number of people you can invite.\n",
